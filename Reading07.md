1. Who is Roy Fielding?
He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet

Because they were not designed to be used like that

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
all about applying verbs to nouns

4. What does a GET do?
it gets stuff for the browser

5. What does a POST do?

6. What does PUT do?
