### nosql vs sql

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL:
Data uses schemas
Has defined realtions
Data is distributed across multiple tables
Uses Vertical Scaling and horzontal scaling is impossible
Limitations for lots of queries

NoSQL:
Does not use schemas
No realtions
Data is typically merged 
Can use both horizontal and vertical scaling
Great performance for mass queries

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
data that is highly strctured and has mant relations

3. Give a real world example.

highly unstructured and relationships are not clearly defined

5. Give a real world example.
a data mining application 

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL databases

7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
SQL databases
